# 📊 Student Marks Analysis

Hi! This is a small project I created to explore how Python can be used for basic data analysis. The idea was to take student marks from a CSV file and perform some analysis using Pandas and Matplotlib.

## 📝 What this project does

- Reads a CSV file containing student names and marks
- Calculates average, highest, and lowest scores
- Shows the results using simple visualizations (bar chart)

It helped me understand how data flows from raw format (CSV) into meaningful insights through code.

## 📂 Files included

- `marks.csv` – Contains sample student data
- `student_marks_analysis.py` – Python script that processes and visualizes the data

## 🔧 Tools used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib** for graphs
